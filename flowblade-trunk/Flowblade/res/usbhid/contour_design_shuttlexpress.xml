  Contour Design ShuttleXpress device driver configuration.

  https://www.contourdesign.com/product/shuttle/

  The Contour Design ShuttleXpress is a USB jog/shuttle device with five
  buttons. It is the smaller version of the Contour Design ShuttlePRO v2,
  which is similar, but has 15 buttons. The two devices share the same
  driver, but use different key maps.

  There are also various rebranded versions of the Contour Design
  ShuttleXpress. It is likely that they should also be able to use this
  driver config if the USB vendor and product IDs match.

  Since the ShuttleXpress is basically a subset of the ShuttlePRO v2, it
  has fewer keys than the larger version. As a result, this means the
  five addressable keys on this device range from 5 through 9.

  The keys on the ShuttleXpress are laid out like this:


                        [7]
                 [6]           [8]

              [5]  (Jog/Shuttle)  [9]
